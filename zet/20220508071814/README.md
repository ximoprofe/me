# How to make a zettel entry

This is the body of the zettel (which means "slip")

* First bullet
* Second bullet

But, when I have an ordered or numbered list:

1. First
2. Second

What if I want *italic* or **bold** or ***bolditalic***?

How about something that looks like `code`?

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello world")
}
```

And when I have a URL I want it to print also so I always write it out like this:

[Link Text](https://paginadeprueba2022.com)

* I put references at the bottom
